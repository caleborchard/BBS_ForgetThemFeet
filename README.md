# Forget Them Feet

![Nate Brown Shoes](https://github.com/caleborchard/BBS_ForgetThemFeet/blob/main/Nate-brownshoes.png?raw=true)

To use this mod, you **must** install [MelonLoader Nightly](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README). All mods for *Baby Steps* currently require the **Nightly** version to work.

Disclaimer: This mod only hides Nate's feet. A majority of the other characters also have bare feet which are not yet hidden. If I have more free time soon, I'll try to make this mod actively search for their feet bones as well.

## Installation

1. Install MelonLoader Nightly.
2. Drag the `ForgetThemFeet.dll` file into the `Mods` folder of your Baby Steps game directory.

## Configuration

After running the game with the mod at least once, you can modify the shoes’ color and size in:
```
Baby Steps/UserData/MelonPreferences.cfg
```
- **Size multiplier**: Adjust to scale the shoes.
- **Color (R, G, B)**: Values are in 0-1 format.
